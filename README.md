The ears will wiggle too. To change the ears for the wiggle animation see "Registration of Ears" down below. You can add the script via Tampermonkey [here](https://github.com/DrBranestawm/BCAR/raw/main/script/bcarLoader.user.js)  
or add it as Bookmark any of your devices. To do that save  <code>javascript:(()=>{fetch('https://drbranestawm.github.io/BCAR/script/bcar.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(r=>eval(r));})();</code> as a bookmark on your devices.

Registration of Ears
----------------------
Currently the only way to change the ears type is to use chat commands. The set easrs will be saved and will work even after relogging.

  - /bcar ear1 : To save your current ears as the primary ear.

Switch your ear to the one you want the secondary ear to be.

  - /bcar ear2 : To save the secondary ears.
